The excerpt presents two contrasting points about population sizes:

1. **Stable Population Sizes**
   > Natural resources are limited, populations are stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation.

   This statement implies that, in general, population sizes tend to remain relatively constant, with only seasonal variations. This stability is likely due to factors such as limited resources, predation, or other environmental constraints.

2. **Theoretical Exponential Growth**
   > The fact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody reproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial population).

   This point acknowledges the theoretical potential for exponential or geometric population growth if individuals reproduce at their maximum capacity, as observed in rapidly reproducing bacterial populations. This scenario assumes no limitations on resources or other constraints.

The apparent contradiction between these two statements can be resolved by understanding that:

- The first statement refers to the observed reality in most natural populations, where resources are limited, and population sizes are regulated by various factors, resulting in relative stability.
- The second statement describes the theoretical potential for exponential growth if there were no limiting factors and individuals reproduced at their maximum capacity.

While populations have the inherent capacity for rapid, exponential growth (as seen in bacteria), in reality, their sizes are typically stable due to resource limitations and other environmental constraints that regulate population growth. This contrast sets the stage for Darwin's concept of natural selection acting on variations within populations.
